[First project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-project?ref=lc-pb) from the [Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails) part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home).  
This is a simple Sinatra app that implements two previous Ruby projects: a Caesar cipher and a Hangman word guessing game.  
The app uses sessions for each Hangman game. A new session is started every time you visit the index page. If you start a game, leave, and then go straight back to the Hangman route, you will continue your previous game.

Images drawn by me using the online [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/sketchpad/) tool.  
They look ugly on purpose, although I couldn't do much better with the drawing anyway.
